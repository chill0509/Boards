To run:
React App: boards-app
  npm start
Asp project:
  dotnet run


Let’s go through each step in detail, focusing on the core concepts, tools, and code examples to help you understand how to build a website like the Boards App from scratch.

1. Project Setup

What You’ll Do:

	•	Set up a basic development environment.
	•	Choose your front-end and back-end frameworks.

Tools:

	•	Code Editor: Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
	•	Node.js: Install Node.js for running JavaScript on the server.
	•	NPM: Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js, used to install libraries and packages.

Steps:

	1.	Install Node.js:
	•	Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
	•	Verify the installation by running node -v in your terminal. You should see the version number.
	2.	Initialize a New Project:
	•	Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to create your project.
	•	Run npm init -y to create a package.json file, which keeps track of your project’s dependencies and scripts.
	3.	Install React:
	•	Run npx create-react-app boards-app to create a new React project. This will set up a basic structure for your front-end.
	•	Navigate to the project folder: cd boards-app.
	4.	Set Up Express.js (for the back-end):
	•	Run npm install express to install Express.js, a web framework for Node.js.
	•	Create a new folder called server in your project.
	•	Inside the server folder, create a file named index.js.
	•	Add the following code to index.js:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 5000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});


	•	Run the server with node server/index.js. Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser, and you should see “Hello World!” displayed.

2. Board Canvas Development

What You’ll Do:

	•	Create the interactive board where users can draw, add shapes, and write text.

Tools:

	•	HTML5 Canvas: A powerful element for drawing graphics.
	•	Fabric.js: A JavaScript library to simplify working with the Canvas.

Steps:

	1.	Set Up Fabric.js:
	•	Install Fabric.js in your React app: npm install fabric.
	2.	Create the Canvas Component:
	•	In your React app, create a new component called BoardCanvas.js.
	•	Inside BoardCanvas.js, set up the Fabric.js canvas:

import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { fabric } from 'fabric';

const BoardCanvas = () => {
    const canvasRef = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const canvas = new fabric.Canvas(canvasRef.current, {
            width: 800,
            height: 600,
            backgroundColor: 'white',
        });

        // Example: Add a rectangle
        const rect = new fabric.Rect({
            left: 100,
            top: 100,
            fill: 'red',
            width: 200,
            height: 100,
        });
        canvas.add(rect);

    }, []);

    return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
};

export default BoardCanvas;


	•	Import and use BoardCanvas in your App.js.

	3.	Add Shapes, Text, and Drawing Tools:
	•	Explore the Fabric.js documentation to add more tools and features, like freehand drawing or adding images.

3. Real-Time Collaboration

What You’ll Do:

	•	Enable real-time updates so that multiple users can collaborate on the board simultaneously.

Tools:

	•	WebSocket: A protocol for two-way communication between the server and clients.
	•	Socket.IO: A library that makes WebSockets easier to work with.

Steps:

	1.	Set Up Socket.IO:
	•	Install Socket.IO in both the client and server:
	•	Server: npm install socket.io
	•	Client: npm install socket.io-client
	2.	Integrate Socket.IO in Your Server:
	•	Update your index.js to include Socket.IO:

const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('a user connected');
    
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('user disconnected');
    });
});

server.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:5000');
});


	3.	Connect the Client to Socket.IO:
	•	In your React app, connect to the server:

import io from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io('http://localhost:5000');

socket.on('connect', () => {
    console.log('Connected to server');
});


	4.	Real-Time Updates:
	•	Use Socket.IO to send and receive updates when users draw or add elements on the board.
	•	Broadcast changes to all connected clients, so everyone sees the updates in real-time.

4. Board Management

What You’ll Do:

	•	Implement a dashboard where users can create, view, and manage their boards.

Tools:

	•	React Router: For navigating between different pages (e.g., dashboard, individual boards).

Steps:

	1.	Set Up React Router:
	•	Install React Router: npm install react-router-dom.
	•	Set up basic routes in your App.js:

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';
import Board from './Board';

function App() {
    return (
        <Router>
            <Switch>
                <Route path="/" exact component={Dashboard} />
                <Route path="/board/:id" component={Board} />
            </Switch>
        </Router>
    );
}

export default App;


	2.	Create the Dashboard Component:
	•	Create a new Dashboard.js component where users can create and view boards.
	•	Use state to manage the list of boards.
	3.	Link to Individual Boards:
	•	In your Dashboard.js, create links to individual boards using React Router.

5. User Authentication

What You’ll Do:

	•	Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.

Tools:

	•	JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication.
	•	Passport.js: A popular authentication middleware for Node.js.

Steps:

	1.	Set Up Passport.js:
	•	Install Passport.js: npm install passport passport-jwt.
	•	Configure Passport in your server to handle user authentication.
	2.	Implement Registration and Login:
	•	Create routes for user registration and login.
	•	Use JWT to generate tokens when a user logs in successfully.
	3.	Protect Routes:
	•	Protect certain routes (e.g., creating a new board) so that only authenticated users can access them.

6. Permissions and Sharing

What You’ll Do:

	•	Allow users to share boards with others and set permissions.

Tools:

	•	Database: Store board permissions in your database.

Steps:

	1.	Store Permissions:
	•	Design your database schema to store information about who owns a board and who can view/edit it.
	2.	Implement Sharing Functionality:
	•	Create a UI for users to share boards via email or a link.
	•	Implement backend logic to check permissions when a user tries to access a shared board.

7. Versioning and Exporting

What You’ll Do:

	•	Allow users to revert to previous versions of their boards and export them as images or PDFs.

Tools:

	•	MongoDB: Store different versions of boards.
	•	html2canvas: For exporting the board as an image.

Steps:

	1.	Store Board Versions:
	•	When a user makes a change, save a new version of the board in the database.
	•	Allow users to revert to previous versions.
	2.	Export Board:
	•	Use html2canvas to capture the board as an image.
	•	Provide an option to download the image or print it.

8. Testing

What You’ll Do:

	•	Ensure your app works as expected by writing tests.

Tools:

	•	Jest: A JavaScript testing framework.
	•	React Testing Library: For testing React components.

Steps:

	1.	Set Up Jest:
	•	Install Jest: npm install jest.
	•	Create test files and write unit tests for your components and functions.
	2.	Run Tests:
	•	Run your tests with npm test.
	•	Fix any issues that arise.

9. Deployment

What You’ll Do:

	•	Deploy your app so others can access it online.

Tools:

	•	Docker: For containerizing your application.
	•	AWS/GCP/Azure: Cloud services to host your application.

Steps:

	1.	Containerize Your App:
	•	Create a

Dockerfile for your app.

	•	Build the Docker image: docker build -t boards-app ..
	•	Run the image locally to test it: docker run -p 5000:5000 boards-app.

	2.	Deploy to the Cloud:
	•	Push your Docker image to a cloud service.
	•	Set up your server and deploy the app.

10. Post-Launch

What You’ll Do:

	•	Monitor your app and plan for future updates.

Tools:

	•	Monitoring Tools: Use services like Google Analytics or AWS CloudWatch.

Steps:

	1.	Monitor Performance:
	•	Set up monitoring to track how users are interacting with your app and identify any issues.
	2.	Plan Updates:
	•	Gather feedback from users.
	•	Plan new features and improvements.
